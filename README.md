# New York Citi Bike Analysis

This project is an analysis of the New York Citi Bike program, the largest bike-sharing program in the United States. Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has been collecting data on the program's utilization and each month, bike data is organized and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on generating regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the Citi Bike program. This analysis aims to answer the following questions:

- How many trips have been recorded in total during the chosen period?
- By what percentage has total ridership grown?
- How have the proportions of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?
- What are the peak hours when bikes are used during the summer months?
- What are the peak hours when bikes are used during the winter months?
- Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? 
- Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? 
- Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? 
- Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? 
- How does the average trip duration change by the type of user? 
- What is the average distance in miles for a bike trip?
- Which bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection in the timespan?
- How variable is the utilization by bike ID?

The final report will contain dashboards and visualizations to answer these questions, along with additional analysis for the observed data phenomena.
